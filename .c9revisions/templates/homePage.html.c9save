There are many different religions, each with a different set of beliefs. The beliefs are about the world and the people in it, about how they came into being, and what their purpose is. </p>\r\n\t<p>Each religion usually has their own type of &quot;devotions&quot; when people worship or pray. They often have religious &quot;rituals&quot; (special things that are always done in the same way) for certain times of the year or certain times of a person's life. Other words that are used for &quot;religion&quot; are &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;belief system&quot;.</p>\r\n\tYou can read more about <a href=\"christ.html\">Christianity</a>, <a href=\"islam.html\">Islam</a> and <a href=\"buddha.html\">Buddhism</a>.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>What's this?</h2>\r\n\t<p>PS: This is a sample site from <strong><a href=\"http://www.labnol.org/\">Digital Inspiration</a></strong> hosted on GAE.
